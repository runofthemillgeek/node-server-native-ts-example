# node-server-native-ts-example

This is a minimal example of a Node.js server written in Typescript that runs without any build steps thanks to the native TypeScript support introduced in Node v22.x.

## TODO
- Update tsconfig and package.json scripts once a new Node 22.x ships that unflags `--experimental-strip-types`
